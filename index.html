		<h1>Valo's Among Us IRL</h1>
		<p>
		An <b>unofficial</b> system of playing a game similar to Among Us that uses real life as a medium.<br/>
		QR Codes can be scanned, leading to tasks, which give codes you can enter into your local instance of the discord bot. With an app this could be streamlined a lot more but this has been designed to not require a dedicated server, which such an app would require.<br/>
		This is still in development at the time of writing this.<br/><br/>
		DISCLAIMER: There are a number of known ways to cheat, though some anti-cheat mechanisms are in place. Some of these are due to the nature of the medium. So you'll have to trust people to not immediately hide while completing tasks after scanning their qr codes. Of course, as this is played locally, rather than with online random players, and there is no real long term benefit or defecit for winning or losing, the likelyhood of individuals cheating is low.
